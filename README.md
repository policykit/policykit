# PolicyKit

Consider the platforms we use for online communities today. These platforms only offer governance options that are top-down, autocratic, and punitive, involving admins and mods. But what if platforms could provide other types of governance, such as more democratic ones? What if communities could <i>build for themselves</i> the governance that suits their needs and values?  

PolicyKit is a governance-authoring application built with [PolicyKit](https://policykit.org/) that leverages [Metagov Gateway's](https://gateway.metagov.org/) open-source API gateway.

PolicyKit currently supports governance-authoring on Slack, Reddit, and Discourse through custom-coded policies for each platform. See the [PolicKit documentation](https://policykit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/writing_policies.html) for more information on how to write a policy, and the Metagov [Gateway documentation](https://docs.metagov.org/en/latest/driver_tutorial.html) on how to extend those policies using the Gateway plugins. Discord support is in development.
